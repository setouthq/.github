# Setout

In construction, the `setout` (or *setting out*) is the process of transferring a building's design plans from drawings onto the actual ground. It involves accurately marking the positions and levels of all key points of a structure before construction begins. Any error here compromises the entire structure.

Modern software development has a `setout` problem. We waste days on setup and collaboration, leading to friction and bugs that start before the first line of code is even written.

**Setout** is the new foundation. We provide an instant, perfectly reproducible development environment in your browser, ensuring your team can start building on a flawless foundation, every single time.
