# Setout, Inc.

In construction, the `set out` is the most critical first step: translating the blueprint onto the ground with perfect precision. Any error here compromises the entire structure.

Modern software development has a `set out` problem. We waste days on setup and collaboration, leading to friction and bugs that start before the first line of code is even written.

**Setout** is the new foundation. We provide an instant, perfectly reproducible development environment in your browser, ensuring your team can start building on a flawless foundation, every single time.
